I am currently a Researcher at [Huawei’s Noah’s Ark Lab](https://dev3.noahlab.com.hk) in the Embodied AI team.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, especially it's application in solving meaningul problems in healthcare and life sciences. I am interested in building intelligent and interpretable systems that assist humans in their daily lives.

I hold an MSc (thesis) in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University, where I worked with [Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/about/ghassans-bio) and a Bachelor’s in Materials Science from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR)](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). In the past, I've worked as a Risk Analyst at [Wells Fargo](https://wellsfargo.com/), as a Research Engineer at [Preferred Networks](https://preferred.jp/en/) in the Bio Team, and as a Research Intern with [Prof. Jonghyun Choi](https://ppolon.github.io) and [Prof. Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io).
